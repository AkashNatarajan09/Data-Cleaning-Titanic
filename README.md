# 🚢 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Titanic Dataset

## Objective
To perform comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing on the Titanic dataset and prepare a structured, machine learning–ready dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
- 891 passenger records
- Target variable: Survived

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Analyzed data types, summary statistics, and missing values
- Treated missing values using appropriate imputation techniques (mean/median for numerical features, mode for categorical features)
- Removed irrelevant and high-missing-value columns (PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin)
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Standardized numerical features (Age, Fare)
- Visualized potential outliers using boxplots
- Applied the IQR method for systematic outlier removal
- Validated the dataset to ensure completeness and consistency

## Output
- Cleaned and structured dataset ready for machine learning models
- All missing values handled
- Categorical variables encoded
- Numerical features standardized

## Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of real-world data preprocessing, feature engineering fundamentals, and preparing datasets for supervised learning models.
